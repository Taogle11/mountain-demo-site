<p class="quote">It is important to seperate the quote from the author because that gives the developer the creative freedom to position and style both.</p>
<p class="author">- Milky Bill</p>
<p class="quote">Earlier in the css file I used a selector that was written <b>'section:not(.hero):nth-child(even)'</b> and that allowed me to to pick every other section excluding the hero at the top of the page. That is kinda dope considering the sinplicity of the idea.  </p>
<p class="author">- Tyler Ogle</p>
<p class="quote">I smell bad and I am really ugly. It is kind of a bummer to be me but at least I have really cool friends like Milky Bill and Goose.</p>

    <p>Honestly the hardest part about laying out this webpage has just been the fact of getting it started. once it was started the repetition of moving from one part of the page to another was 
      always just changing the section giving it a new class putting a header associated with it and then typing out a body into the paragraph element. Anyways put your email below and have nothing happen because I don't know javascript yet.
